# D2: Confirmation Page (Deal Team)

## Purpose
Success confirmation after submitting a request, showing the user what was submitted, who will review it, and what to expect next.

## User Story
As a deal team member, after submitting a request I want confirmation that it was received and information about next steps so I know what to expect.

## Components

### Success Banner
Prominent confirmation message:
- Success icon (checkmark)
- Title: "Request Successfully Submitted"
- Request ID for reference (e.g., "Request #12345")

### Request Summary
Recap of what was submitted:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | Request type (e.g., "NDA Request") |
| Counterparty | Entity name |
| Division | Submitter's division |
| Office | Submitter's office |
| Urgency | Urgency level with SLA reminder |

### Routing Information
Who will review the request:
- **Assigned attorney name**
- Attorney's role/specialty
- **Expected review time** based on urgency/SLA
  - Shows specific date/time deadline

### What Happens Next
Numbered steps explaining the process:
1. Attorney receives notification
2. Request reviewed for conflicts
3. You receive email with decision

Additional note: "You can check status anytime in 'My Requests'"

### Action Buttons
- **View Request** — see request details/status
- **Submit Another Request** — return to blank form (D1)
- **Return to Dashboard** — go to deal team home

## Behavior

### Display Logic
- Request ID generated by system on submission
- Attorney assignment determined by routing logic
- Due date calculated from submission time + SLA

### Email Notifications (background)
On successful submission:
- Requester receives confirmation email
- Assigned attorney receives new request notification
- If high/urgent, additional alerts may be sent

### Navigation
- "View Request" goes to request status/detail page
- "Submit Another" clears form and returns to D1
- "Return to Dashboard" goes to main deal team landing

### Error Handling
If submission failed (shown instead of success):
- Error message explaining what went wrong
- Option to retry or save as draft
- Contact information for support
